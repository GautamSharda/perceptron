# about

a perceptron is a fundamental unit of many neural networks

perceptron.train is a website to experiment with and train perceptrons with different parameters

perceptron.py is intended to be an extremely simple implementation of a perceptron from scratch, without using modern abstractions, for educational purposes

# in progress

parameters: weight data type, number of weights

update_algorithms: sgd, bgd, mgd
